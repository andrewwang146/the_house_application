# the_house_application

Prototype full-stack web application in development (MVP stage), allowing users to create, record, manage and pay out custom wagers with friends.
Users are able to act as 'the house' to be the one either paying out or receiving deposits from bets.

The application uses Django, with HTML and CSS for frontend operations.
